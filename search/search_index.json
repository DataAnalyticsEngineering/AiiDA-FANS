For general information on the usage of AiiDA you should refer to the AiiDA documentation, and for the usage of FANS refer to its repository.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/running-fans/#the-challenging-standard-workflow","title":"The Challenging Standard Workflow","text":"<p>This plugin offers some utilities to help smooth the AiiDA user experience. Namely, the <code>utils.execute_fans</code> function which allows you to provide the inputs for a job as a dictionary of mostly pythonic values. This utility will parse these inputs and automatically use any appropriate existing nodes it finds in your profile before making new nodes where necessary. This is the biggest difference between the standard AiiDA usage pattern and what we offer with Utilities. Ordinarily, it is very easy to end up unintentionally creating duplicate input nodes, resulting in a bloated and disconnected graph of work, without navigating the cumbersome query functions. Utilities aims to free us of this inconvenience. It opperates under the assumption that if a duplicate node would be created, then the existing node should be fetched and used instead. This is a very powerful philosophy when stringently adhered to, but breaks down if ignored.</p> <p>For example, consider the material model input parameter,</p> <pre><code>\"FE_type\": \"HEX8\"\n</code></pre> <p>In the AiiDA database (i.e. graph), this corresponds to a node of type <code>Str</code> with the value <code>\"HEX8\"</code>, and optionally we can label it with <code>\"FE_type\"</code>. When we run a <code>FansCalculation</code> job it must receive a <code>Str</code> node for the FE_type input. If a pythonic <code>str</code> is provided instead, AiiDA automatically converts it to an AiiDA <code>Str</code> and stores the node in the database. Doing it this way, if you run five simulations using hexahedral elements (HEX8), you will end up with five identical unlabeled <code>Str</code> nodes in your database, each pointing to a different <code>CalcJob</code> node. Clearly, the better option would be to have one <code>Str</code> node point to five <code>CalcJob</code> nodes. This could be done by providing each invocation of the <code>FansCalculation</code> job with the same node. So you either have to memorise the primary key of the <code>Str</code> node valued <code>\"HEX8\"</code>, or construct a query to fetch it. In this case, the query appears simple enough,</p> <pre><code>QueryBuilder()\n.append(cls=Str, tag=\"node\")\n.add_filter(\"node\", {\"value\": {\"==\": \"HEX8\"}})\n.all(flat=True)\n</code></pre> <p>but there are dangers herein since if another input parameter happens to have the same value, they would both be fetched. To get around this, you would need to have the foresight to label each node appropriately. Additionally, different data types have different query interfaces, making the overall user experience a challenge.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/running-fans/#using-utilities-instead","title":"Using Utilities Instead","text":"<p>In comes the <code>utils.execute_fans</code> function.
